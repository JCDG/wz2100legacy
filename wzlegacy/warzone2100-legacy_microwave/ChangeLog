Changes for microwave 08/19/2012:
Second release, with a windows build, splash screen waits two seconds before quitting now rather than waiting for user input, borgs can walk through tanks
like they could in 2.3.x (and made grouping far easier), open gates are usable by the enemy now, the default starting height has been raised, several options
including shaders and screen shake are off by default, the configuration directory has changed again, icon updates, quit backsplash update, vtol heights
have been increased a bit and their deceleration speed decreased, no bases and high start power are now the default settings, and alas added a couple new maps.
This changelog may be incomplete. Just search for "Subsentient" in the code to find all/most of my changes.

Changes for microwave 08/18/2012:

First release, updated artwork, changed names and config directories, restored super cannon cyborg from deprecation by HPV borg, 
restored the PIE for super transport and gave it 10 unit capacity, though it now costs 3500 to produce, updated dates and names in the files, etc.
Also added a bunch of CC0-licensed maps for multiplayer. Should add lots more fun for the low oil players of the world.
