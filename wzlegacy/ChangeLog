Changes for 1.0 beta 1:
Allow spectators to be designated before the game starts with the new slot add/remove controls, 
automatically become a spectator if you load up to nothing, and don't lose if this is the case.
Add a makefile for tools/image and make it cross platform.
Fix bug with mouse cursor behaving improperly upon a window stealing the focus.
Allow lobby server address and port number to be set from the command line.
Use classic Warzone 2100 1.10 logo.
New seven player map: Epoch.
Fix map downloading to save in the correct extension, and strip "4c-" and the like since slots are
able to be removed and added at will.
Minor netcode improvements.
Add internal way to check in WZScript and Javascript for spectators, and a way to enable them.
Add a boolean variable to see if a user is a spectator, "NetPlay.players[whoever].spectating".
Fix NSIS installer not installing documentation, and add new splash screen for NSIS.
Add the small programs in tools/ to the NSIS installer as an option, since they may be found useful.
Apply patch by Cyp (with one change to make it compatible with Legacy) to fix Supertransports auto-reloading vtols
that are put inside.
Don't let us lose when we still have VTOL factories.
AIs can pick up artifacts and oil barrels if they are not in a campaign, so skirmish and MP got slightly more challenging.
Show spectators as cyan with no image for their tanks in the intelligence display, made possible by the new NetPlay variable.
Fix "sticky research" bug, a patch by Cyp.
Allow spectators to be enabled and disabled in true multiplayer games.
Warn users it's rude to quit a team game, if they are in teams mode.
Update project URL to http://warzonelegacy.org/
Show map preview when we manually enter a map name and hit enter.
Require autoconf 2.69 to avert funkyness with compiling.
Show unit counts to spectators.
Permit debug mode to be enabled for spectators if in skirmish.

And a TON, a TON of under-the-hood changes, but I won't bore you with these.

Please report bugs at http://forums.warzonelegacy.org/ as usual.
We are nearing a 1.0 stable release and need as many testers as possible.
We hope you enjoy 1.0 beta 1 of Warzone 2100 Legacy!



Changes for 1.0 alpha 2:
Enhanced lobby screen now shows the Host nickname in the main box and shows IPs in the tooltip,
spectator mode is enhanced, debug mode impossible once someone becomes a spectator, and all holograms for all
players become visible as yellow when you enter spectator mode. Netcode improvements, although minor, are present.
Nullbot is now going to be locally modified for Warzone 2100 Legacy from now on and scripts have been adapted fittingly,
fix some Superborgs not requiring cyborg dense composite alloys, re-added fog of war options, fix broken shader support,
updated to newer version of TUBridge map by wei2912, passwords can be changed after a game is already hosted in the lobby,
and add a more sophisticated scavenger AI called SSAS, Subsentient Scavenger AI System, based on the original script.
I probably missed something, but oh well.

Changes for 1.0 alpha 1:
Convert all weapons, bodies, propulsions, structures, and features to PIE 3, removing excess polygons,
put back the original 2.3.x wheels, fix busted pause button in debug menu, update to automake 1.12, require it.
Remove configure script and such stuff, requiring ./autogen.sh first, update documentation a little, allow structures to shoot over
each other again, at the same time fix bunkers shooting through walls by adding boolean to check if we should take structures into 
account when getting line of sight, fix up Windows installer a bit, add multilingual support for core game back, allow IRC-like 
/me messages, but just using the "/", and that about covers it. Balance of the game is almost 100% 2.3.9 compliant, excluding the 
deconstructing oil derricks, which are kinda a bug when disabled, so I left them. We are about ready for showtime folks.

Changes for microwave 11/03/2012:
A large list here this time folks...
Fixed terrain shadow direction, prevented factory holograms from spinning, allow obsolete units to keep producing until aborted (like in 2.3.x),
Fix manpage and create a new installer script for NSIS (Windows), deprecate DPKG support, make a better way of timing our two secs before exiting at
the credits, make ./configure report some info upon completion for convenience, nuke most old documentation and add a little of our own, 
site URL added to game splash screen, make ./wz2100legacy --version report that we are in fact Warzone 2100 Legacy, update netcode to be a bit more stable,
set default map back to Rush-T1 for nostalgia's sake, prevent spamming of CTRL+Insert, pause production/research on win rather than cancel, and don't touch
it at all if we are in an alliances game. This is a must-have upgrade folks. Really good stuff. ENJOY!!!


Changes for microwave 10/27/2012:
Add many maps and two challenges, update nullbot to 1.38, change timer at bottom left ingame to be more like in 2.3.x, 
fix many crashes relating to unclosed network sockets, hopefully reduce the number of games that hang when a player disconnects, 
fix inability to select 640x480 resolution, change spectator command from spec_me to spec me, add key mapping for FPS display, CTRL + ` (~ without shift),
rename backend from qtgame to simply backend, align lobby messages to the left a bit so they are more centered, deprecate Mac OS X support until we can fix it,
update copyrights, and change the default preferred file extension to .wzl for addons and maps. A few under the hood tweaks also took place.

Changes for microwave 08/30/2012:
Spectator support works properly in (most) all circumstances now, we have removed the trap cursor config option,
textures are now at 512 by default, accuracy is now similar to Warzone 2100 2.3.9, and added two new maps, 4c-Yeti and 8c-Origami,
by NoQ and Iluvalar respectively.

Changes for microwave 08/25/2012:
The game now uses the QT backend, with SDL being completely removed and no longer required.
Spectator support now functions properly with the spec_me command in game,
except for when you have an HQ, you'll need to type spec_me again. 
The game will now "pause" and remove all player widgets when the host quits the game.
The map selector has been remade to use smaller buttons, allowing for more maps, and you can enter the
name of a map in the map box now rather than being forced to choose from the menu. Beware of bug:
you need to select a map with the same number of players first if your map of choice is made for more
or less players than the presently selected one, or you will end up with the wrong number of player slots.
This is useful for spectating however. The AI chooser has also been greatly shrunken to provide more AIs.
Nullbot has been added as an AI choice.
OpenGL errors are now console messages, and the game will attempt to continue even if your card seems
to not support the game. This changelog may be incomplete.

While Mac OS X builds are still quite broken, windows builds work.

Changes for microwave 08/19/2012:
Second release, with a windows build, splash screen waits two seconds before quitting now rather than waiting for user input, borgs can walk through tanks
like they could in 2.3.x (and made grouping far easier), open gates are usable by the enemy now, the default starting height has been raised, several options
including shaders and screen shake are off by default, the configuration directory has changed again, icon updates, quit backsplash update, vtol heights
have been increased a bit and their deceleration speed decreased, no bases and high start power are now the default settings, and alas added a couple new maps.
This changelog may be incomplete. Just search for "Subsentient" in the code to find all/most of my changes.

Changes for microwave 08/18/2012:

First release, updated artwork, changed names and config directories, restored super cannon cyborg from deprecation by HPV borg, 
restored the PIE for super transport and gave it 10 unit capacity, though it now costs 3500 to produce, updated dates and names in the files, etc.
Also added a bunch of CC0-licensed maps for multiplayer. Should add lots more fun for the low oil players of the world.
