Hi, this is Warzone 2100 Legacy, a fork of the Warzone 2100 (Resurrection) Project.
Support is present for Windows and Linux. Mac OS X support is unavailable because we have no mac developer. 
If you would like to become that developer, email me (Subsentient) at thinkingrodent@gmail.com.
Please report bugs on the Warzone 2100 Legacy forums, here: http://wzlegacy.universe2.us/forums/

For more information see doc/Readme.en.

NOTE: Functions and additions in code I write may use a non-standard bracketing style that my friends have
dubbed "Subsentient brackets". This is done to condense code and should be perfectly readable. It's also far easier.

Thank you.

-Subsentient, founder of The Warzone 2100 Legacy Project
