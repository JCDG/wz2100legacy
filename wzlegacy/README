Hi, this is Warzone 2100 Legacy, a fork of Warzone 2100 Ressurection Project.
The program has support for Windows and Linux, though windows installer building support is not presently implemented.
Mac OS X support is unavailable because we have no mac developer. If you wuld like to become that developer, email me
(Subsentient) at thinkingrodent@gmail.com.
Please report bugs on the Warzone 2100 Legacy forums, here: http://universe2.us/wzlegacy/forums/

For more information see doc/Readme.en.

NOTE: My code is puke, I use single indentation, a habit I carried from lazy python coding, 
and my braces are in an odd place often, and on top of that
sometimes it'll just be the worst solution ever. Whitespace in my code is only a rumor.

Thank you.
