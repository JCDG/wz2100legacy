Hi, this is Warzone 2100 Legacy, a fork of Warzone 2100 Ressurection Project by Subsentient.
Some things such as make dist and building docs under windows will fail. It may be buggy too. I'm here to fix that. :^)
Report bugs to thinkingrodent@gmail.com.

NOTE: My code is puke, I use single indentation, a habit I carried from lazy python coding, and my braces are in an odd place often, and on top of that
sometimes it'll just be the worst solution ever. Whitespace in my code is only a rumor.

Thank you.
