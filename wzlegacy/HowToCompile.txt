Ok, here's a little tutorial on how to compile.

You will need development and standard packages for the following:

libpopt, qt4 (all of it), yacc, bison, quesoglc, physfs 2.x, libogg, libvorbis, 
automake 1.12 or above, flex, libpng, glew, xrandr, qjson, zip and unzip, 
and of course gcc, autoconf, make, etc.

If I missed something, drop me a line at thinkingrodent@gmail.com.

Now, for the compiling. We only support MinGW/Windows and *nix systems right now, btw.

Linux/BSD/Solaris:
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/usr CFLAGS="-march=native -mtune=native -O3" CXXFLAGS="-march=native -mtune=native -O3"
make

Windows with MinGW and MSYS, or Linux with MinGW:
./autogen.sh
./configure --enable-static --enable-installer --with-installer-version=derp --with-installer-extdir=/path/to/your/usr/bin/ \
--with-distributor="Whoever." --host=i686-pc-mingw32 PKGCONFIG="i686-pc-mingw32-pkg-config" \
CFLAGS="-march=i686 -mtune=generic -O3" CXXFLAGS="-march=i686 -mtune=generic -O3"


ATTEMPTING TO COMPILE WITH AUTOMAKE 1.11 OR BELOW WILL FAIL.
If your distro does not include it, it's an easy thing to compile and very quick at that.
just get 1.12 or above and do ./configure --prefix=/usr && make && make install to fix that issue.

Enjoy!
