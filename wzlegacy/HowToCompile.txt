Ok, here's a little tutorial on how to compile.

You will need development and standard packages for the following:

libpopt, qt4 (all of it), yacc, bison, quesoglc, physfs 2.x, libogg, libvorbis, 
automake 1.12 or above (For git/microwave), autoconf 2.69 or above (For git/microwave), flex, libpng, glew, xrandr, qjson, zip and unzip, 
and of course gcc, make, etc.

If I missed something, drop me a line at thinkingrodent@gmail.com. -Subsentient

Now, for the compiling. We only support MinGW/Windows and *nix systems right now, btw.

Linux/BSD/Solaris:
./autogen.sh (If building the microwave branch from git)
./configure --prefix=/usr CFLAGS="-march=native -mtune=native -O4" CXXFLAGS="-march=native -mtune=native -O4"
make

Windows with MinGW and MSYS, or Linux with MinGW:
./autogen.sh (If building the microwave branch from git)
./configure --enable-static --enable-installer --with-installer-version=derp --with-installer-extdir=/path/to/your/usr/bin/ \
--with-distributor="Whoever." --host=i686-pc-mingw32 PKGCONFIG="i686-pc-mingw32-pkg-config" \
CFLAGS="-march=i686 -mtune=core2 -O4" CXXFLAGS="-march=i686 -mtune=core2 -O4"
make

***Attempting to run ./autogen.sh on a system with Automake lower than 1.12 or Autoconf 2.69 will fail.***
If your distro does not include it, it's an easy thing to compile and very quick at that.
just get 1.12+ for automake, 2.69+ for autoconf, and do ./configure --prefix=/usr && make && make install to fix that issue.

Enjoy!
